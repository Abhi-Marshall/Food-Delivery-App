# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# previous script:

```

  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },

```

# To run express and react simultaneously:

```
=> Method : 1
  
   -> run express using nodemon in one terminal.

   -> run npm run dev for react in other terminal.

```

# To default select an option in select list 

```
=>  use selected keyword also.
=>  <option value="null" disabled selected>Select your role</option>
```

# session method is used for authentication
